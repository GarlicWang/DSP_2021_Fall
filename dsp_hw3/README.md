# ZhuYin Mapping
DSP HW3 

Given corpus, test data, and Big5-ZhuYin mapping file, first implement character segmentation on corpus and text data. Use the segmented corpus to build a language model.  
Next demostrate a mapping from Big5-ZhuYin to ZhuYin-Big5 by Python.  
Finally, use Viterbi algorithm to decode the most likely Big5 from ZhuYin-Big5 mapping, language model on test data.
